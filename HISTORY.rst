This release of lsdviztools adds some command line scripts for plotting basic rasters, chi analysis and concavity analysis.
It also adds functionality for using the opentopography API, including downloading of data using the API key, so it includes, for example, the copernicus DEMs.
It also fixes a bug with gdal that made up a pull request.


0.4.6 (2021-07-23)
------------------

Minor update that includes changes to make sure scripts run.

The four scripts are

* lsdtt_plotbasicmetrics for basic plotting
* lsdtt_plotchianalysis for channel profile analysis and tectonic geomorphology
* lsdtt_plotconcavityanalysis for concavity analysis of river profiles
* lsdtt_grabopentopographydata for grabbing data from opentopography.org


0.4.7 (2021-08-27)
------------------

Some fixes

* For scripts a fix to make sure you have the correct directory without the -dir flag
* A fix to the opentopography api key
* An update to the opentopography scraper that allows lower lef and upper right corners to be easily copied from google maps

0.4.8 (2022-09-15)

Some fixes

* More fixes to the opentopography grabber
* This uses an api key in a file now

0.4.9 (2022-12-13)
------------------

Some fixes

* Added the lsdtt-valley-metrics to the driver interface
* Added point mapping to the plotting tools
* A number of bug fixes to the command line interface


0.4.10 (2023-03-10)

Some fixes

* Added the descartes dependency
* Small change to the swath plotting routine

-------------------

Important fix

* Removed descartes dependency and switched this to a direct plotting routine. This fixes an error caused by transition to python 3.9 in google colab
